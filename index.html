                  </br>
                  Panipuri consists of a round or ball-shaped, hollow puri,
                   filled with a mixture of flavored water, tamarind chutney,
                   chili powder, chaat masala, potato mash, onion or chickpeas.
                   It is tangy rather than sweetish while the water is sour and spicy.

                  <b><u>Dosa</u></b> </br>
                  A dosa is a rice pancake, originating from South India, made 
                  from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in 
                  appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground 
                  together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented.

                  A pillowy pav, stuffed with a golden-fried spiced batata (potato) vada,
                  covered with a lick of tamarind and coriander chutneys and a sprinkling
                  of garlicky masala - the vada pav is starch heaven, an instant energy booster.
